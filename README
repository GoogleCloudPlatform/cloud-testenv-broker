TODO: prepare this README for public consumption.

Dependencies:

Latest and greatest from:

go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

http://www.github.com/google/protobuf
http://www.github.com/google/grpc

be sure to have:
grpc_python_plugin in your path (from grpc)

for python preferably within a virtualenv :

from grpc/src/python/src (example with a prefix).
C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/prefix/include LIBRARY_PATH=~/prefix/lib python setup.py install

BE CAREFUL, this downgrades protobuf/python (installed from below) so reinstall
in that order.

from protobuf/python
python setup.py install

Quick instructions.

1. Clone this project in you $GOPATH/src
2. ./gen.sh (should generate a bunch of go files
    in $GOPATH/sec/google and in the python subdir.
3. ./run.sh
